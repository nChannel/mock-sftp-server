# Description
**mock-sftp-server** uses [ssh2's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssh2) server functionality to make a test sftp server for unit testing. 
This module neither reads nor writes to the file system, and should only be used to test against.

This is a work in progress and not all sftp functionlity has been added to the wrapper.

# Usage
```javascript
const mockSftp = require('@nchannel/mock-sftp-server');

const listing = [
  {
    '/foo': [
      { filename: 'bar', attrs: {} },
      { filename: 'not.afile', attrs: {} }
    ]
  },
  {
    '/bar': [
      { filename: 'foo', attrs: {} }
    ]
  }
];
const debug = false;
const port = 4000;

const mockSftpServer = mockSftp.sftpServer({ listing, debug, port }, done);

// After writing a file to /foo
expect(mockSftpServer.computedFileSize('/foo')).to.equal(42);
expect(mockSftpServer.computedSha256('/foo')).to.equal('abcd3959');
```

## listing
listing is an array that contains objects that have a directory path as its keys. Each key then contains an array of with file objects. This is what would be returned by a `readdir` from a client.

Defaults to an empty array.

## debug
This is true or false. If true, you will need to include the DEBUG env var when running your applications as the Debug modules is used to output debug logs. I am may make an update to allow the user to choose to use the Debug module or console.log, in the future.

Defaults to false.

## port
This is your desired port of the mock server.

Defaults to `port 4000`.

## Current server functionality
As of now, you can only run `connect`, `fastGet`, `fastPut`, `readdir`, `unlink`, `rename` and `end` from your client to the mock server.

`fastGet`, `fastPut`, `readdir`, `unlink`, `rename` requires you to get the `sftp` method from the client.

```javascript
conn.sftp((err, sftp) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  sftp.readdir('/foo', (err, list) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.dir(list);
    conn.end();
  });
});
```
